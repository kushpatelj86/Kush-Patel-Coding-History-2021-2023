GIL:Global interpreter lock
-A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python




-Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe




- ways to Avoid:
  - Use multiprocessing
  -Use a different, free-threaded Python interpreter(Jython, IronPython)
  -use Python as a wrapper for third party libraries(C/C++) -> numpy,scipy
