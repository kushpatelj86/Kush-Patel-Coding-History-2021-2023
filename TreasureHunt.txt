It's a beautiful garden, but doesn't seem to have any evidence that treasure is here (``ls`` only showed this file, ``README.md``) Maybe we should try the house!

# House

Welcome to the house! There's a distinct feeling that the treasure is closer. Muddy footsteps head towards the front room. What's in there? Go in and check it out!

```
cd front_room
ls
cat README.md
```
$ cd front_room/
$ ls
README.md
$ cat README.md 
# Front room

A cozy front room, but no treasure. The tracks head into the kitchen. Let's go up to the house/ directory and into the kitchen/ instead!

Don't forget you can type ``pwd`` to figure out where you are right now!

Note that when you type ``pwd`` your full location is printed, and it starts with a ``\``. That slash indicates an absolute path, whereas a path that does not start with a ``\`` is a relative path to the current working directory.

So from the house directory, we could type the relative path to the kitchen directory, and it would work:

```
cd kitchen
```

But we cannot do this, because there is no kitchen directory at the root of your filesystem:

```
cd /kitchen
```

Ready to go back and look in the kitchen?

```
cd ..
cd kitchen
ls
cat README.md
```
$ cd ..
$ ls
README.md  front_room/  kitchen/  upstairs/
$ cd kitchen/
$ ls
README.md
$ cat README.md 
# Kitchen

It's the kitchen! Smells like pie, yum. But there's no treasure. Let's go upstairs!

We can jump straight to another directory by chaining commands, so instead of ``cd ..`` and then ``cd upstairs``, we can simply type ``cd ../upstairs``. Try it!

```
cd ../upstairs
ls
cat README.md
```
$ cd ..
$ ls
README.md  front_room/  kitchen/  upstairs/
$ cd upstairs/
$ ls
README.md  bedroom/
$ cat README.md 
# Upstairs

The door to the bedroom is ajar and a golden light peaks through... what is it?

```
cd bedroom
ls
```
$ ls
README.md  bedroom/
$ cd bedroom/
$ ls
TREASURE.md  bed/  closet/
$ cat TREASURE.md 
# Treasure

Congratulations! You found the treasure! It's here in the bedroom directory.

Type ``pwd`` to figure out where we are now.
