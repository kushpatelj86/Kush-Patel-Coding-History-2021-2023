Process: An instance of a program (e.k a Python interpreter)


+Advantages
+Take advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+Seperate memory space -> Memory 
+Great for CPU bound processing
+New peocess is stated indepedently from other processes
+Processes are interruptable/killable
+One GIL for process -> avoids GIL limiations


-Disadvantages
-Heavyweight
-Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
-More memory
-IPC(inter-process communication) is more complicated
